        "ATE MY BALLS was a 1990's Internet meme that spawned from saying, \"Mr. T Ate My Balls.\" Pages were made of other celebrities and entities declaring that they, too, ATE MY BALLS. This site attempted to collect them all, and while the site is still up, most of the ATE MY BALLS pages it links to are down. So I've provided the archive.org link so you can browse them."
