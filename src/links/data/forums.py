        "A vaporwave and nostalgia forum with an undeserved reputation for harboring schizoids. Practically it's a refuge from highly moderated spaces for people all over the world whose values tend towards reactionary.",

        "Cozy board that reminds me of Hacker News for people trying to escape the modern Internet. Its most notable feature is that it supports unencrypted use, making it appealing to users with ancient devices who aren't worried about the encryption.",

        "This is a shady Internet marketing forum. You can learn a lot here but be aware that everyone will scam you if you let them. The entire forum is built on scamming ignorant people. You can learn a lot but you can't take everything said at face value. Don't give anyone your money unless you know what you're doing. Just lurk and be skeptical.",

        "https://www.troublefreepool.com",
        "This is the best place on the Internet to get mostly unbiased information about home pool maintenance. Something you figure out when you get a pool is that the products are expensive and almost all knowledge that is out there is designed to take advantage of your ignorance and push you towards products that make you dependent on spending more. This is required reading for anyone who is going to maintain a pool.",
